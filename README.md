<!-- Breif Description -->

## Overview

Overlook Hotel is a website that can be used for Customers and Managers to login see their daily data and manage bookings. The Customers after login are shown the amoun they have spent at Overlook Hotel and have the ability to search for rooms by date and room type. They can then book that room and see it updated in their dashboard. As a manager you can search for customers to see their data and bookings as well as remove or add bookings for that customer.

This is a project for Turing school to utilize our knowledge on a variety of front end tools and get a better understanding of the request/response cycle. It also tested our understanding of Class inheritance as well as array prototype methods.

## How to use

   As a customer you can login with the username of customer12 or whatever number you would like to match a customer and the username of overlook2020. Then on your customer page scroll through the bookings you have. If you select a date from the date field it will give you a list of all rooms that match your date and type available that you can book.   
   As a manager you can login with username manager and password overlook2020. Then you can search a customer by name, for example "Era Hand." After this you can see that customers past and future booking and remove any booking that are in the future. If you select the Add tab you can then search and add bookings for that user by selecting dates and room numbers.
